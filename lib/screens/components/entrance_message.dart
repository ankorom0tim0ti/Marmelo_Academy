const String addmisionPolicyIntroduction = '''
**Marmelo Academy’s Features**\n
Marmelo Academy has 2 features: “Group Matching” and “Gemini Facilitation”.
First, 5 people are matched into a group chat.
Then, Gemini acts as a conversation facilitator there, directing what to talk and what to do. Users only have to follow the instructions from Gemini.
These features create a unique experience of conversation.

const String addmisionPolicyUser = '''
**Our Target**\n
Anyone who wants to create generative AI-based apps is welcome.
Their problem is that it’s difficult to develop new apps by themselves.
Marmelo Academy provides a place to form a community by “Group matching” and support discussion by “Gemini facilitation”.

const String addmisionPolicyGoal = '''
**User's Goal**\n
Users get a community, project brief, schedule, and task list for app development kickoff.
Our development milestones include, of course, outputting the good old Excel Gantt charts and figma wireframes.

const String curriculumMessage = '''
After logging in, users set up their profiles to begin the matching process. Once matched, AI will introduce members to each other. After getting acquainted, each member proposes ideas, leading to discussions and the finalization of the team's product idea. Following this, the AI supports scheduling and task creation towards project completion, as well as coordinating dates for the next sessions.
